<h1>Client enquiry information</h1>

<h2>Cat 1 & 2 Responders and the Voluntary and Commercial Sector</h2>

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response provides all-terrain support to Category 1 and 2 Responders
(as defined in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004) and to other Voluntary and
Commercial Agencies working in the Care sector.
<p>

<p>
This can come via the Local Resilience Forum (LRF) or direct via the form
below.
</p>

<p>
Our Volunteer Responders are trained to operate in adverse weather conditions,
typically where others have been advised not to travel unless absolutely
necessary.  Our objective, as is yours, is the preservation of life and our
role is to provide logistic support to those requiring transport to achieve
that aim.
</p>

<p>
We provide transport in times of severe weather (Snow, Gales, Heavy Rain or
Floods) or across rough terrain, to transport essential personnel, supplies or
equipment to areas that would be inaccessible  or hazardous to standard
vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Usually, we do not charge for this service but a donation to the Group is
gratefully received
</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response is a voluntary organisation with around 12 volunteers who donate their time and use of their own personal vehicles, when required. Where possible, coverage can be provided across the whole county (24/7, 365 days a year).
</p>
<p>
When a vehicle is required, our Dispatch &amp; Control Team will identify the most appropriate vehicle for the task, based on location and operational requirement. All our Responders vehicles have 4-wheel drive.
</p>
<p>
For transporting personnel, we can provide 7–seater vehicles. For transporting equipment/supplies, our vehicles can carry payloads up to 1500Kg. We are also able to tow trailers of up to 3500Kg, with most types of coupling.
</p>
<p>
In the event of a major incident, we are able to call on additional resources from neighbouring 4x4 Response Groups, within the 4x4 Response UK network.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
Some of the services we are able to provide include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Transport of Doctors, Nurses, Care Workers to work and house-calls, in rural areas, in heavy snow.
</li>
<li>
Delivery of urgent medication or hot meals.
</li>
<li>
Transport of Rescue personnel and equipment across rough terrain.
</li>
<li>
Assisting with the evacuation of vulnerable people from areas which have flooded or are at risk of flooding.
</li>
<li>
Contingency escorting of conventional vehicles in adverse conditions
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment</h3>

<p>
We can only deploy resources where we have an existing Herts 4x4 Response
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in place, and you should follow the procedure
agreed within your organisation, or with the Nth Herts, East Herts Emergency
Planning Teams who will make contact with our Duty Controller.  We welcome
enquires from Cat 1&2 Responders, Voluntary and Commercial organisations from
within the Care sector who would like to put a Herts 4x4 Response MoU in place
to use our services. 
</p>

<p>
Simply complete the form below start the 4x4 Response Agreement process.
</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response is not only restricted to activities in the Winter months,
we also use our skills and 4x4 vehicles for other purposes, such as: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Event Set-up and Breakdown
</li>
<li>
Marshalling – our vehicles and volunteers can assist in marshalling the crowds
with a friendly smile.
</li>
<li>
Traffic Management – Additional support at authorised Road Closures
</li>
<li>
Traction Assistance – If the weather turns wet and drivers are having problems
getting out of sodden or muddy car parks, Herts 4x4 Response can be there to
tow them out.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Mobile patrol</h3>

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response can use their vehicles to mount mobile patrols around the car parking areas to assist or advise those that require it.
