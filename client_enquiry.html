<h1>Client enquiry information</h1>

<h2>Cat 1 & 2 Responders and the Voluntary and Commercial Sector</h2>

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response Group provides all-terrain support to Category 1 and 2 Responders
(as defined in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004) and to other Voluntary and
Commercial Agencies working in the Care sector.
<p>

<p>
This can come via the Local Resilience Forum (LRF) or direct via the 
<a href="contact_client.html">contact page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our Volunteer Responders are trained to operate in adverse weather conditions,
typically where others have been advised not to travel unless absolutely
necessary.  Our objective, as is yours, is the preservation of life and our
role is to provide logistic support to those requiring transport to achieve
that aim.
</p>

<p>
We provide transport in times of severe weather (Snow, Gales, Heavy Rain or
Floods) or across rough terrain, to transport essential personnel, supplies or
equipment to areas that would be inaccessible  or hazardous to standard
vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Usually, we do not charge for this service but a donation to the Group is
gratefully received
</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response Group is part of a national organisation. 
When our services are required, our Dispatch &amp; Control Team will identify
the most appropriate vehicle for the task, based on location and operational
requirement. All our Responders have 4-wheel drive vehicles. Our group
of Responder Volunteers, donate their time and use of their own personal
vehicles.

For transporting personnel, we can provide 7–seater vehicles. For transporting equipment/supplies, our vehicles can carry payloads up to 1500Kg. We are also able to tow trailers of up to 3500Kg, with most types of coupling.

Where possible, coverage can be provided across the whole county (24/7, 365 days).
