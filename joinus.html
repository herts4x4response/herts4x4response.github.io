<h2>Additional information for response volunteers</h2>

<h3>Insurance</h3>
<p>
<b>Volunteer Drivers</b>
</p>

<p>
Motor insurers recognise that policyholders who want to help their communities
through volunteer driving need clear and accurate information.  The ABI has
introduced volunteer driving commitments to provide guidance on the matter. The
following page sets out information on volunteering in general.
</p>

<p>
If you are a volunteer driver <b>you may not be covered automatically</b> by your
regular motor insurance policy.  Volunteer drivers are those who work for
voluntary organisations but do not receive any payment for their work.  Some
insurers cover volunteer driving within regular motor insurance policies while
others may charge an extra premium or impose a higher excess for volunteer
drivers.
</p>

<p>
If you use <b>your own vehicle</b> for volunteer driving
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Contact your insurer to find out if you are covered by your regular motor insurance policy
</li>
<li>
Include your volunteer driving miles when declaring your annual mileage to your insurer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Insurers who do not charge extra for volunteer driving have signed up to the
<b>ABI’s volunteer driving – motor insurance commitment</b> (<a href="https://www.abi.org.uk/globalassets/files/publications/public/motor/2021/abi-guide-to-volunteer-driving---the-motor-insurance-commitment-2021.pdf">download PDF, 781kB</a>).
</p>

<p>
This commitment applies to private vehicles insured on private motor insurance. Some of these insurers require you to tell them that you are using your vehicle for volunteer driving even though they do not charge an extra premium.
</p>

<p><b>Next Steps</b></p>

<p>
Contact your insurer if:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
They have signed up to the ABI’s commitment but they require you to tell them
you are a volunteer driver
</li>
<li>
They have not signed up to the ABI’s commitment as you may have to pay an extra
premium to ensure you are fully covered
</li>
</ul>
