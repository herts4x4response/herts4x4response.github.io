</p>

<p> A 4-wheel drive vehicle can provide invaluable support, in times of severe
weather (Snow, Flood, Other emergencies and circumstances where remote
locations and/or uneven terrain is involved), and we endeavour to assist the
Emergency Services, when requested.
</p>

in all weathers, at all times of the day or night, 365 days of the year.

Response Volunteers who do not have a 4x4, support the team through Event
support, Marshalling, Publicity or Admin, etc.

<p>
Herts 4x4 Response Group is part of the national 4x4 Response UK charity.

<h2>About 4x4 Response UK</h2>

<p>
<b>National</b>
<br/>
4x4 Response is a national Charitable Incorporated Organization (CIO) Charity 
and operates at two distinct levels.
National and Regional.  Nationally, it is called <b>4x4 Response UK</b> and acts as an
umbrella organisation supporting the Regional Groups.  It is constituted as a
Charity with a group of Trustees, elected by its members.  Regionally, each
Group is run autonomously, on a day-to-day basis (This is where the fun
happens). 
</p>

<p>
<b>Regional Groups</b>
<br/>
4x4 Responders use their own 4x4 vehicles.  Relationships are built with local
‘clients’ and Local Resilience Forums to assist them, as and when required.
Regional Groups can be called upon by any Category 1 or 2 Responder (as defined
by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004) and by Voluntary and Commercial agencies,
with whom they have an agreement.  Regional Groups can work directly with
‘clients’ either ‘On Standby’, ‘Call Out’ and occasionally provide mutual
support for neighbouring 4x4 Response Groups.  Not all Regional Groups are
individual charities, although some have gained this status.

<p>
Thanks for taking the time to read this and for your interest in our Group.
